# Hello, world!

This is CS50 AP, Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming for students in high school, which satisfies the College Board's new AP CS Principles curriculum framework.

Students in CSP will also benefit from topics from this curriculum, while AP students will delve deeper into topics in preparation for the Exam.
