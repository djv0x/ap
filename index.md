# Hello, world!

This is CS50 AP, Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming for students in high school, which satisfies the College Board's new AP CS Principles curriculum framework.

Etowah students will have an opportunity to reach out to faculty from Harvard if they'd like to delve deeper into topics.
