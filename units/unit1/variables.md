## Variables

In this section, we'll dive into variables in C. A variable is a storage container for data that is capable of holding different values that may change or update as programs execute. Your program can read the contents of a variable, update the contents of a variable, and display the value of a variable on the screen. Computer programs can use variables in order to remember useful information that the programs can then use later in the code.

- ### Submit your answers & your program to CANVAS as a variables.c file
  - Why do we need variables?
  - What would happen to our programs if we couldn't use variables?
  - If we didn't have access to variables, how would this affect your program?

- ### Write a program that:
  - novice coder: create a program that adds two numbers together given by a user
  - comfy coder: create a program that finds the average of three positive numbers given by a user
  - l33t coder: create a program that finds the square of a number given by a user
